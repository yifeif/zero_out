# TensorFlow Custom Ops
This is a template/example of building custom ops for TensorFlow.

## Try building example zero_out op

### Use Docker
Pull the provided Docker container from Docker hub.

```bash
  docker pull yifeif/tensorflow:custom_op
  docker run -it yifeif/tensorflow:custom_op /bin/bash
```

Inside Docker container for image tensorflow/tensorflow:custom_op, clone this repository. 
```bash
git clone -b test https://github.com/yifeif/zero_out.git
cd zero_out
```

### Build pip package

With bazel:
```bash
  ./configure.sh
  bazel build build_pip_pkg
  bazel-bin/build_pip_pkg /tmp/zero_out_pip
```

With Makefile:
```bash
  make pip_pkg
```

### Test pip package
First install the pip package we just built with
```bash
pip install /tmp/zero_out_pip/*.whl
```
Then test out the pip package
```bash
cd ..
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;import tensorflow_zero_out as zero_out_module;print(zero_out_module.zero_out([[1,2], [3,4]]).eval(session=tf.Session()))"
```

## Create and distribute custom ops
Clone the repository

Rename tensorflow_zero_out direcotry with the name of your ops. Add your kernel implementation and op registration at <your op>/cc/kernels/*.cc and <your op>/cc/ops/*.cc.

For each op shared library you are creating, add them to <your op>/BUILD similar to target "python/ops/_zero_out_ops".
